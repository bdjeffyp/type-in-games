# Type-In Games

Games written in BASIC in magazines and books for various microcomputers.

Computers will have their own subfolders. Each game has it's own folder and contains the type-in code and the PRG file for use with an associated emulator.

Contents of a game folder will get uploaded to Gaming Alexandria for archiving.
