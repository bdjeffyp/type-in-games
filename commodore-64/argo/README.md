# ARGO

This game's listing is found on page 131 of the book ["More than 32 BASIC Programs for the Commodore 64 Computer"](https://archive.org/details/More_Than_32_BASIC_Programs_for_the_Commodore_64), written by Tom Rugg, Phil Feldman, and Western Systems Group.

Description of how the game is played can be found in the book. You can play the game by using the PRG file with the VICE emulator. Download the file, drag it onto the emulator, and the game will load the title screen.

**NOTE:** There is a bug with how the game displays the input characters as they are partially hidden behind the timer. This is due to an issue with the offset for displaying the word. I made a fix in the argo-fixed.prg to shift the player's input over 10 spaces, so that it matches up with what the game is supposed to look like in the first screenshot of page 134 in the book.
