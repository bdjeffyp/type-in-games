This game's listing is found on page 155 of the book ["More than 32 BASIC Programs for the Commodore 64 Computer"](https://archive.org/details/More_Than_32_BASIC_Programs_for_the_Commodore_64), written by Tom Rugg, Phil Feldman, and Western Systems Group.

Description of how the game is played can be found in the book. You can play the game by using the PRG file with the VICE emulator. Download the file, drag it onto the emulator, and the game will load the title screen.

**NOTE:** There is an issue with the formatting of the code on page 160, lines 650-750, where there appear to be tabs between characters near the end of those lines. The code in this repo is modified to remove the tabs as appropriate.
