Game Instructions –
1. On the title screen, enter the target score that is needed to win the game.
2. The game randomly chooses who goes first: the player or the computer.
3. Dice are rolled.
  a. If you got numbers on both dice, the results are added together.
  b. You can then pass to the opponent and bank your score by pressing the P key.
  c. You can risk getting more points and roll again by pressing the R key.
  d. If you get a "GROAN" (the 1 on a die which appears as a frown face), your turn ends and all points for that round are lost.
  e. If you get double "GROAN", the word "DESPAIR" is shown. All points banked are lost.
4. Play continues back and forth until one player reaches the target score when they bank their points.
