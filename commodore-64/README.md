# Commodore 64 Games

Game type-in listings included here are written as they appear in their books or magazines for preservation purposes. Any special characters are converted to use the appropriate control code that the petcat utility can convert.

An issue with copying and pasting game listings into the Commodore 64 is that the case of characters is shifted. Uppercase characters will become special symbols and lowercase characters will become uppercase. This issue also affects how petcat generates the PRG files. If you decide to modify a listing, make sure to convert the listing into lowercase characters prior to using petcat or copying the code into the Commodore 64 directly.

- **Why not just write the listings in lowercase? Why have this case shifting process?** This is because the code listings in the various sources are typically written as they appear in their source material for preservation of the original listing.
